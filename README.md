# Ricks-Team-Capstone-Project
This application is going to be a learning tool used by our client to teach his students how the different aspects of a game are altered and interact with 
each other throughout the span of a game. To accomplish this, the game allows the user to view the game through different "lenses" that show some individual aspects of the game and its object.

This will be done using a simple game of PONG. In order to use this, you must run the .html file using Live Server in Visual Studio Code in order to run the game. While playing, use the arrow keys to move your paddle up and down. If you would like to change the current "lens" that you are viewing the game through, you can press the number keys.

Release Notes:
Milestone 1 - Initial creation of the engine and some basic game objects.

Milestone 2 - Full creation of the base PONG game, complete with start screen, play screen, and end screen.

Milestone 3 - Created the mechanism from which to turn lenses on and off, as wells as created the first 3 out of 8 lenses.
              These lenses are the scene, time, and input lenses.

Milestone 4 - Completion of the rest of the lenses. Those being the velocities, components, spaces, colliders, and layers.
              We have also implemented a pause feature in order to get a better look at the lenses while the game is playing.
              Finally we added a controls menu at the start scene so that the user can see all the controls.
